1. Yes and no. The graph has a little bit of a normal distribution, the coldest (<12C)and hottest (>30C)
daily temperatures have a lower population density range (not exceeding 2500 people/km^2), while the 
mild daily temperatures (12C-30C) have a larger population density range (up to 7000 people/km^2). However,
while there are cities with mild daily temperatures that have high population density, there's also ones that
have lower population density. So we can predict it in the way that the cities with more extreme daily 
temperatures will likely not have a high population density; however, we cannot predict the population 
density of cities with mild daily temperatures.

2. It might be faster because the compressed file is many times smaller than the uncompressed, so when the 
CPU is loading it into memory when running the program, it will be faster since it is much smaller. However, 
if the uncompressed file is still relatively small, then leaving it uncompressed will be faster.
