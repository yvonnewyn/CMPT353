1. np.sqrt was the closest, the weekend dataset passed the normality test, and the weekday dataset is very close to passing.

2. 
Original T-test: The number of comments on weekdays vs weekends differ.
Transformed data T-test: Since the transformation method of taking the square root is reasonable and commonly used, we are assuming that the relationship between the means didn't change.
Thus, the conclusion for if we reject the null hypothesis stays the same: the number of comments on weekdays vs weekends differ.

3. In my opionion approach number 4 (Mann-Whitney U test) does a better job of getting an answer for the original question. Approach 1 and 2 (original and transformed) will not even be considered 
since they violate the assumption that the data is normally distributed and have equal variance. Approach 3 and 4 (CLT and u test) both do a great job of getting an answer, however, approach 4 
worked on the original data instead of transformed data (even if it is just combining the counts of each week), thus it is a little better in regards to getting an answer for the original question
in my opinion.

4. Weekdays.
