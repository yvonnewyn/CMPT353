1. 
(1) reddit-0: 32.1 seconds
(2) reddit-2, no schema, no cache: 53.8 seconds
(3) reddit-2, schema, no cache: 39.3 seconds
(4) reddit-2, schema, cache: 47.5 seconds 

Since cache is acting up for reddit-2, I did cache vs no-cache on reddit-3 as well; here are the results:
No cache: 2:20.4 minutes
Cache: 1:25.7 minutes

2. Based on the above, it looks like the majority of the time taken is used to read the files. 
This is shown by the run with a specified schema taking 14 seconds less than the run with no schema 
specified. Since no schema means Spark has to read the dataset twice, while a specified schema means 
Spark only has to read the dataset once, it means one read takes around 14 seconds. 
The run with reddit-0 shows that Spark startup takes around 30 seconds. The run wtih reddit-2, schema, 
and no cache took around 39 seconds. That means it took 9 seconds to read the file and calculate the averages, 
and since one read takes around 14 seconds, that means calculating the averages takes nearly no time at all.

3. .cache() is used after filtering out the non english articles, main pages, and titles starting 
with 'Special:'
