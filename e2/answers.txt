1. The result of the calculation is the prediction of the rating based on the timestamp. 
The intercept is what the rating would be if timestamp was at 0. The slope is how fast the rating is 
rising. From my calculations, the intercept is -28.13 and the slope is 2.71.

2. This creates a fit line because it is plotting y = mx+b, x being the timestamps (converted from datetime),
and y, the result, is the rating based on x, the date or time. The timestamp values is the numerical 
representation of the created_at values, which was used to create a best fit line which was then plotted 
against the created_at values. So it was paired correctly because they're the same values.
