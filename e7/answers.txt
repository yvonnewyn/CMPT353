1. Yes, the histograms of the residuals seems close-enough to being normal. It has a peak in the middle while the two sides are lower, forming a normal-ish distribution. We can also reasonably 
conclue that the ratings are increasing, as the OLS p-value is very close to 0, aka definitely smaller than alpha (0.05), thus we can reasonably reject the null hypothesis that the slope 
is 0. And looking at the plot it is clear that the slope is positive instead of negative, thus the ratings are increasing.

2. Since the predictions are the result of ML trained from real data, I think that it should be better. Although this graph has a lot more noise ompared to the previous graph from exercise 3, 
that is mostly due to the raw data having more data points.
